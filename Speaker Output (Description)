Place the piezo buzzer into the breadboard, so that the two leads are on two separate rows.
Using jumper wires, connect the positive lead to Arduino digital pin 8.  The case of the buzzer may have a positive sign (+) on it to indicate the positive lead (if not, then the red wire usually indicates the positive lead).
Connect the other lead to the 100 ohm resistor, and then to ground.
