Arduino KY-037 Sensitive microphone sensor module

High-sensitivity microphone sensor module

Sound Sensor Module (with Analog & Digital Outputs)

Microphone sound detection module

For sound detection Module has two outputs:

AO, analog output, real-time output voltage signal of the microphone

DO, when the sound intensity reaches a certain threshold, the output high and low signal

The threshold-sensitivity can be adjusted via potentiometer on the sensor

Connecting to the Arduino

Pin + to Arduino 5+

Pin - to Arduino -

Pin A0 to Arduino A0 (for analog program)

Pin D0 to Arduino 13 (for digital program)
